# This is my Cherry visualizer project

## Overview of the App
This app aims to provide a seamless solution for visualizing the difference between a healthy cherry tree and those containing the disease.


## Creating the app pages

* The intial task will be to create the necessary pages for the business.

## Dataset contents

(Amount of data in the dataset, describing what the data is and each type of data)

## Business Requirements

(Describe the needs of the owner and the goal of creating the app)

## Hypothesis and how to validate

• It is believed that the infected cherry tree contains a powdery mildew which should be visibile in the data provided, clearly differentiating them from a healthy tree.

• An average image study can help to investigate this

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks

(Data visualization and categorization of each type. Displaying different findings correlating to the business requirements.)

## ML business case

## Dashboard Design (Streamlit App User Interface)
